# Overview

<a href="https://staging.blackcattattoos.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Black Cat Tattoo & Piercing Parlour
</a> is a website that I made for a client
needing a website to showcase their work and
services. It was built using TypeScript, Astro, and NixOS. It allowed the client to upload and manage their tattoos and
various content using a self hosted CMS called Directus.

# How was it built?

It was built using Astro for SSG, TypeScript as the main language, NixOS and Hetzner for the Server, Directus for the
CMS
and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The Code is available
on <a href="https://github.com/james-d12/Websites/tree/main/web/sites/blackcattattoos.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
